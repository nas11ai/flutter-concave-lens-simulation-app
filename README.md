# flutter_concave_lens_simulation_app

This is an app that I created for one of my college projects. This app uses physics law i.e. concave lens formula to draw the shadow line. This app is still in beta.
If you want to run this app, I suggest you to run it on web browser, because I haven't created it to be responsive and adaptive, but hey, at least it works lol.

When you start the app, it should look like this in the web browser:

You can move the slider to change the line in the app like this:
